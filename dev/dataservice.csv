Interest Restriction Return (IRR) API,,,"## Overview

  The API in its current state supports the following functions:

  - Revoke an existing Reporting Company from submitting Interest Restriction Returns
  - Appoint a new Reporting Company for submitting Interest Restriction Returns
  - Submit an Interest Restriction Return (full)
  - Submit an Interest Restriction Return (abbreviated)

  This API uses User Restricted Endpoints. Please find further details on the [Authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation) page.

  For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, see [Tutorials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).

  ## Errors

  We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

  - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
  - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
  - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

  Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors) for more on errors.

  ## Testing

  You can use the [HMRC Developer Sandbox](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing) to test the API. The Sandbox is an enhanced testing service that functions as a simulator of HMRCâ€™s production environment.

  ## Versioning

  When an API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, we increase the version number of the API. See our [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning) for more on versioning.
